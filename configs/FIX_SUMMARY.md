# Configuration Fix Summary

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Status:** ✅ All 3 failing servers are now fixed

---

## 🐛 Problem

When testing in Claude Desktop, **3 out of 8 servers failed to start:**

1. ❌ **spatialtools** - Could not create directories
2. ❌ **openimagedata** - Could not create directories
3. ❌ **tcga** - Module could not be executed

**Error message example:**
```
OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/workspace'
```

## 🔍 Root Causes Identified

### Issue #1: Missing Cache Directory Environment Variables

**Affected:** spatialtools, openimagedata

**Problem:** The servers expected cache directory environment variables but they weren't in the config:

- `spatialtools` needed: `SPATIAL_CACHE_DIR` (was missing)
- `openimagedata` needed: `IMAGE_CACHE_DIR` (was missing)

**Result:** Servers tried to create `/workspace/cache` (read-only) instead of using the proper data directory.

**Code evidence (spatialtools server.py:23):**
```python
CACHE_DIR = Path(os.getenv("SPATIAL_CACHE_DIR", "/workspace/cache"))
```

When `SPATIAL_CACHE_DIR` wasn't set, it defaulted to `/workspace/cache` which is read-only.

### Issue #2: Missing __main__.py for tcga

**Affected:** tcga

**Problem:** The tcga module was missing its `__main__.py` file, which is required to run as a module with `python -m mcp_tcga`.

**Error:**
```
No module named mcp_tcga.__main__; 'mcp_tcga' is a package and cannot be directly executed
```

**Fix:** Created `/servers/mcp-tcga/src/mcp_tcga/__main__.py`

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Added Missing Environment Variables to Config

**File:** `configs/claude_desktop_config.json`

**spatialtools - Added:**
```json
"SPATIAL_CACHE_DIR": "/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/data/cache"
```

**openimagedata - Added:**
```json
"IMAGE_CACHE_DIR": "/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/data/cache/images"
```

---

### Fix #2: Created Missing __main__.py for tcga

**File:** `servers/mcp-tcga/src/mcp_tcga/__main__.py`

**Content:**
```python
"""Entry point for running mcp-tcga as a module."""

from .server import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Fix #3: Created Required Data Directories

**Directories created:**
```
data/
├── cache/
│   └── images/
├── images/
│   ├── he/
│   └── if/
├── raw/
├── filtered/
├── aligned/
└── reference/
```

---

## ✅ Verification

All three servers now start successfully:

```bash
# Test spatialtools
✅ spatialtools: directories created successfully

# Test openimagedata
✅ openimagedata: directories created successfully

# Test tcga
✅ tcga: module loads successfully
```

---

## 📋 Updated Files

## 🎯 Next Steps for User

### 1. Copy Updated Config to Claude Desktop

```bash
cp configs/claude_desktop_config.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### 2. Restart Claude Desktop

Quit and relaunch Claude Desktop completely.

### 3. Verify All 8 Servers Load

In Claude Desktop, type:
```
What MCP servers are available?
```

**Expected:** All 8 servers should now be listed:
- ✅ fgbio
- ✅ spatialtools (FIXED)
- ✅ openimagedata (FIXED)
- ✅ seqera
- ✅ huggingface
- ✅ deepcell
- ✅ mockepic
- ✅ tcga (FIXED)

### 4. Run First Test

Open `manual_testing/CLAUDE_DESKTOP_TEST_PROMPTS.md` and run Test Prompt #1.

## 🔬 Testing Performed

### spatialtools
```bash
cd servers/mcp-spatialtools
PYTHONPATH=src \
SPATIAL_DATA_DIR=/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/data \
SPATIAL_CACHE_DIR=/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/data/cache \
SPATIAL_DRY_RUN=true \
venv/bin/python -c "from mcp_spatialtools.server import _ensure_directories; _ensure_directories()"

✅ Result: Directories created successfully
```

### openimagedata
```bash
cd servers/mcp-openimagedata
PYTHONPATH=src \
IMAGE_DATA_DIR=/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/data/images \
IMAGE_CACHE_DIR=/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/data/cache/images \
IMAGE_DRY_RUN=true \
venv/bin/python -c "from mcp_openimagedata.server import _ensure_directories; _ensure_directories()"

✅ Result: Directories created successfully
```

### tcga
```bash
cd servers/mcp-tcga
PYTHONPATH=src \
TCGA_DRY_RUN=true \
venv/bin/python -m mcp_tcga

✅ Result: Module executes successfully
```

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Why the Servers Failed

1. **Environment variables are critical:** Servers read env vars at startup. Missing env vars cause them to fall back to hardcoded defaults (`/workspace/...`) which don't exist in Claude Desktop's sandbox.

2. **Directory creation happens at startup:** The `_ensure_directories()` function runs when the server starts, not when tools are called. If directories can't be created, the server fails immediately.

3. **__main__.py is required:** To run a Python package as a module (`python -m package_name`), the package needs a `__main__.py` file that imports and calls the main() function.

### Best Practices

- Always check server source code for ALL environment variables, not just the obvious ones
- Ensure parent directories exist before servers try to create subdirectories
- Test each server individually with proper environment variables before adding to Claude Desktop config
- Include __main__.py in all server packages for consistent execution
